# üíº Salary Prediction Model

**Project File: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zZhyFMuXrXDgkCO20zYk9zwvYontkQ7S?usp=sharing**
**Note: The dataset has been acquired from kaggle.com and has been uploaded to this repo.**

This project implements a **prediction model using Linear Regression** to estimate an employee's salary.  
The model uses multiple features to capture different aspects of an employee's profile:  

- Experience  
- Tenure  
- Session Index  
- Gender Index  
- Location  
- Tech Stack

## üöÄ Roadmap of Machine Learning Project  

This project follows an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for regression tasks:  

### 1. **Data Collection**  
- Load the dataset (`Employe_Performance_dataset.csv`).  
- Inspect data structure, features, and target (Salary).  

### 2. **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- Handle missing values (imputation or removal).  
- Remove duplicates and fix inconsistencies.  
- Encode categorical variables (`GenderIdx`, `Location`, `Tech Stack`).  
- Standardize/normalize numerical features (`Experience`, `Tenure`, `Session_Idx`).  

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Visualize salary distribution.  
- Study correlations between features and salary.  
- Detect outliers in salary or experience data.  

### 4. **Feature Engineering**  
- Create derived features if beneficial (e.g., interaction terms).  
- Scale numerical features for regression stability.  
- Apply encoding methods (Label/One-Hot Encoding) for categorical data.  

### 5. **Splitting the Dataset**  
- Train-Test split (commonly 80:20).  
- Ensure randomization for unbiased evaluation.  

### 6. **Model Building (Linear Regression)**  
- Train Linear Regression on preprocessed features.  
- Fit the model using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).  
- Interpret regression coefficients to understand feature importance.  

### 7. **Model Evaluation**  
Evaluate predictions with regression performance metrics:  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** ‚Äì average absolute errors.  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** ‚Äì penalizes larger errors.  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** ‚Äì interpretable in salary units.  
- **R¬≤ Score (Coefficient of Determination)** ‚Äì variance explained by the model.  

### 8. **Model Validation**  
- Apply k-fold cross-validation to check robustness.  
- Compare Linear Regression with baseline models (Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor).  

### 9. **Deployment (Future Scope)**  
- Save the trained model using `joblib` or `pickle`.  
- Deploy as an API using Flask/Django.  
- Build a simple frontend for interactive salary prediction.
